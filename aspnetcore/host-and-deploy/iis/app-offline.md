## Locked deployment files

Files in the deployment folder are locked when the app is running. Locked files can't be overwritten during deployment. To release locked files in a deployment, stop the app pool using **one** of the following approaches:

* Use Web Deploy and reference `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` in the project file. An *app_offline.htm* file is placed at the root of the web app directory. When the file is present, the ASP.NET Core Module gracefully shuts down the app and serves the *app_offline.htm* file during the deployment. For more information, see the [ASP.NET Core Module configuration reference](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module#app_offlinehtm).
* Manually stop the app pool in the IIS Manager on the server.
* Use PowerShell to drop *app_offline.htm* (requires PowerShell 5 or later):

  ```powershell
  $pathToApp = 'PATH_TO_APP'

  # Stop the AppPool
  New-Item -Path $pathToApp app_offline.htm

  # Provide script commands here to deploy the app

  # Restart the AppPool
  Remove-Item -Path $pathToApp app_offline.htm

  ```


## app_offline.htm

If a file with the name *app_offline.htm* is detected in the root directory of an app, the ASP.NET Core Module attempts to gracefully shutdown the app and stop processing incoming requests. If the app is still running after the number of seconds defined in `shutdownTimeLimit`, the ASP.NET Core Module kills the running process.

While the *app_offline.htm* file is present, the ASP.NET Core Module responds to requests by sending back the contents of the *app_offline.htm* file. When the *app_offline.htm* file is removed, the next request starts the app.

When using the out-of-process hosting model, the app might not shut down immediately if there's an open connection. For example, a websocket connection may delay app shut down.
