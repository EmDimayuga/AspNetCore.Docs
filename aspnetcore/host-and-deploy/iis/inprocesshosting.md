### In-process hosting model

Using in-process hosting, an ASP.NET Core app runs in the same process as its IIS worker process. In-process hosting provides improved performance over out-of-process hosting because requests aren't proxied over the loopback adapter, a network interface that returns outgoing network traffic back to the same machine. IIS handles process management with the [Windows Process Activation Service (WAS)](/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/features-of-the-windows-process-activation-service-was).

The [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module):

* Performs app initialization.
  * Loads the [CoreCLR](/dotnet/standard/glossary#coreclr).
  * Calls `Program.Main`.
* Handles the lifetime of the IIS native request.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between IIS, the ASP.NET Core Module, and an app hosted in-process:

![ASP.NET Core Module in the in-process hosting scenario](index/_static/ancm-inprocess.png)

1. A request arrives from the web to the kernel-mode HTTP.sys driver.
1. The driver routes the native request to IIS on the website's configured port, usually 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
1. The ASP.NET Core Module receives the native request and passes it to IIS HTTP Server (`IISHttpServer`). IIS HTTP Server is an in-process server implementation for IIS that converts the request from native to managed.

After the IIS HTTP Server processes the request:

1. The request is sent to the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline.
1. The middleware pipeline handles the request and passes it on as an `HttpContext` instance to the app's logic.
1. The app's response is passed back to IIS through IIS HTTP Server.
1. IIS sends the response to the client that initiated the request.

In-process hosting is opt-in for existing apps. The ASP.NET Core web templates use the in-process hosting model.

`CreateDefaultBuilder` adds an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.IServer> instance by calling the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderIISExtensions.UseIIS*> method to boot the [CoreCLR](/dotnet/standard/glossary#coreclr) and host the app inside of the IIS worker process (*w3wp.exe* or *iisexpress.exe*). Performance tests indicate that hosting a .NET Core app in-process delivers significantly higher request throughput compared to hosting the app out-of-process and proxying requests to [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel).

Apps published as a single file executable can't be loaded by the in-process hosting model.

## Application configuration

### Enable the IISIntegration components

When building a host in `CreateHostBuilder` (*Program.cs*), call <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Host.CreateDefaultBuilder*> to enable IIS integration:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        ...
```

For more information on `CreateDefaultBuilder`, see <xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#default-builder-settings>.

**In-process hosting model**

To configure IIS Server options, include a service configuration for <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IISServerOptions> in <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartup.ConfigureServices*>. The following example disables AutomaticAuthentication:

```csharp
services.Configure<IISServerOptions>(options => 
{
    options.AutomaticAuthentication = false;
});
```

| Option                         | Default | Setting |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | ------- |
| `AutomaticAuthentication`      | `true`  | If `true`, IIS Server sets the `HttpContext.User` authenticated by [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth). If `false`, the server only provides an identity for `HttpContext.User` and responds to challenges when explicitly requested by the `AuthenticationScheme`. Windows Authentication must be enabled in IIS for `AutomaticAuthentication` to function. For more information, see [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth). |
| `AuthenticationDisplayName`    | `null`  | Sets the display name shown to users on login pages. |
| `AllowSynchronousIO`           | `false` | Whether synchronous I/O is allowed for the `HttpContext.Request` and the `HttpContext.Response`. |
| `MaxRequestBodySize`           | `30000000`  | Gets or sets the max request body size for the `HttpRequest`. Note that IIS itself has the limit `maxAllowedContentLength` which will be processed before the `MaxRequestBodySize` set in the `IISServerOptions`. Changing the `MaxRequestBodySize` won't affect the `maxAllowedContentLength`. To increase `maxAllowedContentLength`, add an entry in the *web.config* to set `maxAllowedContentLength` to a higher value. For more details, see [Configuration](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits/#configuration). |



### In-process hosting model

ASP.NET Core apps default to the in-process hosting model.

The following characteristics apply when hosting in-process:

* IIS HTTP Server (`IISHttpServer`) is used instead of [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server. For in-process, [CreateDefaultBuilder](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#default-builder-settings) calls <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderIISExtensions.UseIIS*> to:

  * Register the `IISHttpServer`.
  * Configure the port and base path the server should listen on when running behind the ASP.NET Core Module.
  * Configure the host to capture startup errors.

* The [requestTimeout attribute](#attributes-of-the-aspnetcore-element) doesn't apply to in-process hosting.

* Sharing an app pool among apps isn't supported. Use one app pool per app.

* When using [Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy) or manually placing an [app_offline.htm file in the deployment](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#locked-deployment-files), the app might not shut down immediately if there's an open connection. For example, a websocket connection may delay app shut down.

* The architecture (bitness) of the app and installed runtime (x64 or x86) must match the architecture of the app pool.

* Client disconnects are detected. The [HttpContext.RequestAborted](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.RequestAborted*) cancellation token is cancelled when the client disconnects.

* In ASP.NET Core 2.2.1 or earlier, <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory*> returns the worker directory of the process started by IIS rather than the app's directory (for example, *C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv* for *w3wp.exe*).

  For sample code that sets the app's current directory, see the [CurrentDirectoryHelpers class](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module/samples_snapshot/3.x/CurrentDirectoryHelpers.cs). Call the `SetCurrentDirectory` method. Subsequent calls to <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory*> provide the app's directory.

* When hosting in-process, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationService.AuthenticateAsync*> isn't called internally to initialize a user. Therefore, an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IClaimsTransformation> implementation used to transform claims after every authentication isn't activated by default. When transforming claims with an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IClaimsTransformation> implementation, call <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.AuthenticationServiceCollectionExtensions.AddAuthentication*> to add authentication services:

  ```csharp
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddTransient<IClaimsTransformation, ClaimsTransformer>();
      services.AddAuthentication(IISServerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
  }

  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
      app.UseAuthentication();
  }
  ```
  
  * [Web Package (single-file) deployments](/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/web-deployment-in-the-enterprise/deploying-web-packages) aren't supported.

### Process name

`Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName` reports `w3wp`/`iisexpress` (in-process) or `dotnet` (out-of-process).

Many native modules, such as Windows Authentication, remain active. To learn more about IIS modules active with the ASP.NET Core Module, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/modules>.

The ASP.NET Core Module can also:

* Set environment variables for the worker process.
* Log stdout output to file storage for troubleshooting startup issues.
* Forward Windows authentication tokens.
