## Create the IIS site

1. On the hosting system, create a folder to contain the app's published folders and files. In a following step, the folder's path is provided to IIS as the physical path to the app. For more information on an app's deployment folder and file layout, see <xref:host-and-deploy/directory-structure>.

1. In IIS Manager, open the server's node in the **Connections** panel. Right-click the **Sites** folder. Select **Add Website** from the contextual menu.

1. Provide a **Site name** and set the **Physical path** to the app's deployment folder. Provide the **Binding** configuration and create the website by selecting **OK**:

   ![Supply the Site name, physical path, and Host name in the Add Website step.](index/_static/add-website-ws2016.png)

   > [!WARNING]
   > Top-level wildcard bindings (`http://*:80/` and `http://+:80`) should **not** be used. Top-level wildcard bindings can open up your app to security vulnerabilities. This applies to both strong and weak wildcards. Use explicit host names rather than wildcards. Subdomain wildcard binding (for example, `*.mysub.com`) doesn't have this security risk if you control the entire parent domain (as opposed to `*.com`, which is vulnerable). See [rfc7230 section-5.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4) for more information.

1. Under the server's node, select **Application Pools**.

1. Right-click the site's app pool and select **Basic Settings** from the contextual menu.

1. In the **Edit Application Pool** window, set the **.NET CLR version** to **No Managed Code**:

   ![Set No Managed Code for the .NET CLR version.](index/_static/edit-apppool-ws2016.png)

    ASP.NET Core runs in a separate process and manages the runtime. ASP.NET Core doesn't rely on loading the desktop CLR (.NET CLR). The Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR) for .NET Core is booted to host the app in the worker process. Setting the **.NET CLR version** to **No Managed Code** is optional but recommended.

1. *ASP.NET Core 2.2 or later*:

   * For a 32-bit (x86) [self-contained deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) published with a 32-bit SDK that uses the [in-process hosting model](#in-process-hosting-model), enable the Application Pool for 32-bit. In IIS Manager, navigate to **Application Pools** in the **Connections** sidebar. Select the app's Application Pool. In the **Actions** sidebar, select **Advanced Settings**. Set **Enable 32-Bit Applications** to `True`. 

   * For a 64-bit (x64) [self-contained deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) that uses the [in-process hosting model](#in-process-hosting-model), disable the app pool for 32-bit (x86) processes. In IIS Manager, navigate to **Application Pools** in the **Connections** sidebar. Select the app's Application Pool. In the **Actions** sidebar, select **Advanced Settings**. Set **Enable 32-Bit Applications** to `False`. 

1. Confirm the process model identity has the proper permissions.

   If the default identity of the app pool (**Process Model** > **Identity**) is changed from **ApplicationPoolIdentity** to another identity, verify that the new identity has the required permissions to access the app's folder, database, and other required resources. For example, the app pool requires read and write access to folders where the app reads and writes files.

**Windows Authentication configuration (Optional)**  
For more information, see [Configure Windows authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth).

## Deploy the app

Deploy the app to the IIS **Physical path** folder that was established in the [Create the IIS site](#create-the-iis-site) section. [Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy) is the recommended mechanism for deployment, but several options exist for moving the app from the project's *publish* folder to the hosting system's deployment folder.

### Web Deploy with Visual Studio

See the [Visual Studio publish profiles for ASP.NET Core app deployment](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) topic to learn how to create a publish profile for use with Web Deploy. If the hosting provider provides a Publish Profile or support for creating one, download their profile and import it using the Visual Studio **Publish** dialog:

![Publish dialog page](index/_static/pub-dialog.png)

### Web Deploy outside of Visual Studio

[Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy) can also be used outside of Visual Studio from the command line. For more information, see [Web Deployment Tool](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/use-the-web-deployment-tool).

### Alternatives to Web Deploy

Use any of several methods to move the app to the hosting system, such as manual copy, [Xcopy](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/xcopy), [Robocopy](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy), or [PowerShell](/powershell/).

For more information on ASP.NET Core deployment to IIS, see the [Deployment resources for IIS administrators](#deployment-resources-for-iis-administrators) section.

## Browse the website

After the app is deployed to the hosting system, make a request to one of the app's public endpoints.

In the following example, the site is bound to an IIS **Host name** of `www.mysite.com` on **Port** `80`. A request is made to `http://www.mysite.com`:
